step1- Make a folder e.g-navigation
step2-make another folder for your all screens e.g-screens
step3-Under your Screens folder make different components for different screens e.g-Home.js,About.js etc..
step4-go to your navigation folder and create a navigator components.
because we are using v4 so i am using this 
import { createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
 instead of 
import { createAppContainer, createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation';
step5- create an createStackNavigator({}) this will be an object (take 2 arg) which hold all your screen with an
identifer e.g-
home:HomeScreen identifier name up to you which you want in my case 'home' home is identifier for my HomeScreen.js components
about:AboutScreen
